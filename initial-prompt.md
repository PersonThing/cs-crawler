Familiarize yourself with this repo. I want to use it as inspiration for a new game built to run natively using godot.

Top down multiplayer RPG with a customizable skill + skill modifier system, random item generation system, enemies, random generated levels. Currently implemented as a 2d parallax type rendering system that mimics 3d. We're going to rebuild it in godot with full 3d, but still a fixed perspective (but nearly straight down) camera. Possibly with some zooming and camera bobbing or angling for effects, but mostly out of the user's control.

Skill system: I was happy with where this was going and want to continue along those lines. Skills are customizable by chaining modifiers - like a fireball with pet modifier makes a pet that follows you and shoots fireballs. I had planned a far more complex modifier system, and want to think this through more, along with possible effects, interactions between modifiers, etc. Skills and modifiers are unlocked via items, and made more effective (leveled up probably) by using them, which might be tracked per damage type (fire proficiency increased every time you use a fire spell) or tracked per ability, or both? Different kinds of damage and effects depending on damage type etc. I want offensive and defensive pets and turrets. I want players and their pets and turrets to be able to help each other with buffs, heals, etc. I want enemies to be able to do the same with each other. Some enemy types will buff others or heal them or, for example, one big enemy might toss smaller enemies towards players. Or when more than 3 of a certain kind of enemy are together, they get mad and charge and explode. Think up ideas like that.

The tile and block based level idea was ok but not perfect. we want to be able to randomly generate levels eventually. Possibly using waveformcollapse approaches, possibly some older style approach. We might use pre-made tiles for rooms/corredors/etc, or we might generate from blocks all the way up, and let the game engine chunk things instead of loading whole tiles at a time. I'm not sure what's best. Leaning on you for ideas and advice here.

I would like to stick with a pixelated look - possibly just a shader ? I don't know 3d graphics very well. Give me some options / ideas.

The item system and inventory was decently fleshed out in the existing repo. Items should affect your character model - each item type would have a 3d model and possibly a rasterized 2d inventory texture.

We want it to be a very fast paced dungeon crawler style game with lots of mobs dying and items dropping. I want it to be easy to change skills and modifiers and experiment, at least for now.

It should start out easy to survive and a bit slow paced, but very quickly get more difficult and require you to really grind and scale to be effective. It should be satisfying to play even at low power levels - satisfying attack effects, short gcds so you feel like you have agency, punishing but predictable enemies so skill in positioning or knowledge of how they work matters.

It needs to be multiplayer, at least lan for now. The backend can be written in just about anything. The backend should be authoritative, with client prediction and server correction. Don't look at my implementation for that, it wasn't very good, I didn't really know what I was doing.

Players should be able to open the game, see a list of other players online, click a game to join it, or create their own game. Players will have the option to disable auto-join when starting a game. If so, other players will have to "request to join" to enter it. There should be a basic chat interface - pressing enter opens a chat box to type, scrolling chat messages on the bottom left. Server should store list of characters per player in a database, and world state in memory (possibly persisted to redis with a short timeout in case the game server crashes, but never to disk/db). Help me explore tech stack and architecture options for backend, I'm not super familiar with game dev best practices. I know go, c#, nodejs/javascript/typescript. I'm also curious about rust. I'm open to any of those directions for the server. I don't expect to plan for massive scale - probably 100 players online max for now.

Client will probably be latest godot with GDscript, but I'm open to other suggestions, as long as you (Claude) are able to generate 100% or nearly 100% of the files needed for it.

For the first pass, let's just focus on establishing tech stack, high level architecture, and high level game concepts and decisions. Don't look at every line of code written currently, just get the gist of how each system works. We'll decide what to investigate in more detail once we've made some decisions.
